Please convert this image into an anime-style illustration inspired by the visual aesthetics of Studio Ghibli. Maintain the original composition and key elements, but reimagine them with Ghibli-style features - soft, painterly textures, warm and natural color palettes, detailed backgrounds, and expressive character designs. Aim for a whimsical and nostalgic atmosphere, capturing the magical realism often seen in Ghibli films like My Neighbor Totoro, Spirited Away, or Howl's Moving Castle.
